(defmacro add-hook! (hooks &rest rest)
  "A convenience macro for adding N functions to M hooks.

This macro accepts, in order:

  1. The hook(s) to add to.
  2. Optional properties :local, :append, and/or :depth [N].
  3. The function(s) to be added: this can be a quoted function, a quoted list
     thereof, a list of `defun' or `cl-defun' forms, or arbitrary forms (will
     implicitly be wrapped in a lambda).
